        <p>
          This Cookies Policy explains how Ecomm ("we", "us", or "our") uses
          cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our
          website at ecomm.com ("Website"). It explains what these technologies
          are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of
          them.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Ecomm) are called
          "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website
          owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable
          third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
          website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The
          parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer
          both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
          certain other websites.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          Why do we use cookies?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
          are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
          cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
          interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
          Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
          advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more
          detail below.
        </p>

          access to secure areas.
        </p>

          Performance and functionality cookies:
        </h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of
          our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these
          cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">
          Analytics and customization cookies:

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Advertising cookies:</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to
          you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from
          continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for
          advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based
          on your interests.

          Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to
          serve advertising through our Website. These companies may use
          information about your visits to this and other websites in order to
          provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may
          be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to
          measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished
          by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your
          visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant

          The information collected through this process does not enable us or
          them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that
          directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
